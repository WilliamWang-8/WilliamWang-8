# Hi! I'm Will

I'm a first-year studying materials science & engineering at **Northwestern University**. I'm an undergraduate researcher in the **Haile Group** (Materials and Devices for Sustainable Energy) wind tunnel engineer for **NUSTARS** (rocketry society), and mix team member for **Concrete Canoe**.

Previously, I conducted DFT + Monte Carlo simulations under Prof. Robert Topper at **Cooper Union** and developed a novel transgenic insertion of a SX4 P-element in fruit flies as part of the Stan-X molecular biology program at **The Lawrenceville School**.
