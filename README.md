## Hi! I'm Will

I'm a first-year at studying materials science & engineering at **Northwestern University**. I am an undergraduate researcher in The Haile Group (Materials and Devices for Sustainable Energy), wind tunnel engineer for NUSTARS (rocketry society), and mix team member for Concrete Canoe.

Previously, I conducted DFT + Monte Carlo simulations under Prof. Robert Topper at **Cooper Union** and developed a novel transgenic insertion of a SX4 P-element in fruit flies as part of the Stan-X molecular biology program at **The Lawrenceville School**.
